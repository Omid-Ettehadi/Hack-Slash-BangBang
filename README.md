Project Description:
Humans Vs Zombies is a human interaction game that uses smartphones
based on the classic playground game, Rock Paper Scissors.
After learning more about multiscreen projects and their nature to 
create an interactive experience for their audience, we  focused 
on using the smartphones as tools to enhance the user's experience
in playing the game.

Status:
V 1.0 : 
1. Chose a Character -> 2. Click to start ->
3. Ready to shake -> 4. The result of Shake.

V 2.0 :
Simpler version, included no dynamic switching of Human and Zombies
in the interface. The two versions are identical in how they run,
but the graphics and sound effects are different.
Version 2.0 allows the users to keep shaking the device to bring up
the next random card,  whereas in the advanced version you have to 
reload the page to start a new game.
